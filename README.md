# Media Playlist Cases
Create a set of classes to represent & manipulate a media playlist
Code should understand music, podcasts, & movies
All should be able to report their name & duration
Music should report the artist, while movies should know their rating
Any type of media can be added to a playlist
A playlist should keep track of what is being played, controlled by a "next()"
method & checked with the "playing()" method
Have a way of sorting the playlist, ideally in a way that's easily modifiable
with future code
